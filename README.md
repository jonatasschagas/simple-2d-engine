# simple-2d-engine

This engine is designed to streamline the development of simple 2D games across multiple platforms. By providing a foundational structure, it allows developers to focus on building their games without getting bogged down by the intricacies of platform-specific libraries.

Built with minimalism in mind, the engine offers the essential building blocks for creating 2D games, making it easier and faster to bring your game ideas to life.

Explore a **full example of how to use this engine** in the [simple-2d-engine-demo](https://github.com/jonatasschagas/simple-2d-engine-demo) repository.

You can find a **walkthough of the engine** [here](https://github.com/jonatasschagas/simple-2d-engine/blob/main/getting-started.md).
